# techview-api
An API that aggregates tech reviews written by media groups.

## Motivation

When people shop for new devices, they often read and watch reviews from various media groups before making a big financial decision. TechViews API aims to simplify the research phase by aggregating these reviews into one place.

## Features 

- Built using Express.js, a Node.js framework.
- Contains aggregated reviews for two devices.

## Future Plans

- My goal is to support a variety of smartphones, gaming consoles, and laptops in effort to assist buyers during the holiday season
